vvvv do all of this once resource limits are raised

1. I decide which branch / commit I want the image based off of
  - add ci-build-me to anything you want circleci to make an image for
2. go to build-artifacts-docker--testnet_postake_medium_curves--coda-daemon
3. get the image "successfully tagged"...

codaprotocol/coda-daemon:0.0.15-beta-hotfix-prover-and-verifier-in-same-process-8afff0f

4. check no other network is running: kubectl get namespace - all running testnets

5. change name of testnet, ex. nightly
6. and change coda image
7. see block_producer_config; do fewer fish for a smaller network, and change snark worker replicas

8. when ready, from root of repo, run
  ./scripts/auto-deploy.sh pickles

9 to check the network
  ./scripts/ezcheck
  ./python scripts/testnet-validation/best_tip_trie.py pickles3
  note: ezcheck may not fail, but will return multiple hashes of best tips. For example, block height 95/96. Some may be out of sync. Still on same chain. Check out best_tip_trie.py to get a better understanding of it.
10. Ask Izzy/Conner on Grafana when have a network running


Evan Todo

Goals:
- A script which takes latest develop, launches a network off of it, runs health tests on it
- Working preemptive networks
